Transform Twitter Feeds to Rss

### What is this?

It is a web application written in python use to transform tweet in RSS feed. Well, right now it is more a __proof of concept__... All you have to do is install the web application on your server and subscribe with your RSS client to something like that *http://tweet2rss.exemple.org/kevadamsss* if you want to contemplate french mediocrity or to something more relevant if you prefer.

### What do I need?
Right now, python 3.5. Well, I work with Python 3.5, but maybe it works with older version, I don't know. Give it a try. And if doesn't work, too bad then.

### How does it work?

Just git clone the project, install the requierements and launch Tweet2Rss. Then, open your browser, go to *http://localhost:8080/tw/nadine__morano* for look at one of the best french politian/humorist ever. Tada! A mighty RSS feed

### Do I need a Twitter account or some API key shit or something?

No. I aim to directly parse the HTML output of the Twitter website.

### But if I want to follow a protected account?

You can't right now. And, let's be honnest, probably never will.

### But if twitter decide to change their HTML output?

Then I'm fucked and I will need to change the code.

### Why do you do this?

Because I don't want to register on their site but still I want to *follow* some interesting account.

### Is this legal?

Yes. Maybe. I guess.

### Why do you use python instead of cool tecs like node or ruby?

Why don't you go fuck yourself with a shovel?
